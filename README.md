Special thanks to the Hackalist guys for maintaining their API so I can grab their data!

Current contributors:

<a href="https://www.github.com/mding5692">Michael Ding</a>

Current Functionality:
- Shows location of hackathons with ability to be pressed for more details

Current bugs
- Cannot go past Google Maps Geocoding Query limits - currently using a workaround

Future Directions
- More Hackathon locations
- Dynamically update hackathons based on API
- See if travel reimbursements are needed based on current location
